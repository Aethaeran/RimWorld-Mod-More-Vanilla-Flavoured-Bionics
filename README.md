# More Vanilla-Flavoured Bionics
This is a mod I made ages ago. It was originally made for RimWorld version 0.19.2009 rev486.
For kicks, I have now re-worked it for 1.3. 

If I can figure out how to pull down 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 versions of RimWorld from Steam, I will support those versions as well.

[//]: # (TODO: RimWorld 1.0 support)
[//]: # (TODO: RimWorld 1.1 support)
[//]: # (TODO: RimWorld 1.2 support)

The idea for, and the mod itself, is simple. I just wanted some more [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software) flavoured [bionics](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Artificial_body_parts). Specifically the three organs that could only be replaced by harvesting them from other pawns at the time. 
I also didn't approve of there not being Archotech variants of each bionic. As a result, I have added the following item, hediff, and medical recipe definitions to the game:

- Bionic Kidney
- Bionic Liver
- Bionic Lung

- Archotech Ear
- Archotech Heart
- Archotech Kidney
- Archotech Liver
- Archotech Lung
- Archotech Spine
- Archotech Stomach

Overall, I tried to keep all the added items on par with similar counterparts
- All added bionic implants are unlocked after researching [Bionic Replacements](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Research#Bionic_replacements)
- All added Archotech implants can only be attained through trading.
- Mass from either the bionic variant or natural BodyParts
- partEfficiency for bionics @ 1.25
- partEfficiency for archotech @ 1.5
- Etcetera

I probably won't push this to [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/294100/workshop/) anytime soon, nor the [Ludeon forums](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php). If you wish to use the mod simply git clone, or download this repository into your RimWorld mods folder.
